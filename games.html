    <p class="styled-paragraph">These days every parents keep video games away from their children. 
        They think video games harm minds of their children, spoiling them. 
        They might right to some extent since games which are meant for mature 
        audiences are often played by teens below 18. On the other hand, studies
        show that games could increase attention span and even there are career 
        opportunities for people who plays it as profession. Enough said, I played
        Nintendo, those old schools games are one of a kind. Popular one person shooter
        games and motorcycle racing games and PS2 Spiderman game are my childhood memories
        After matriculation, it was hard to for me to give time in these. But 
        may be one day I would get back to these!
