        <p class="styled-paragraph">Movie is the only mean of media that allows me look upon the diverse
            nature of human psychology through a character and rediscover myself. It might be someone
            quote but I thought it would be better to write it here. Ever since my
            childhood I came across movies, I wondered the life of the actors were 
            larger than life. I started with Marvel films like most other Indian 
            teen would do. Later I watched movies that has open ending, twisted 
            characters, complex themes. Some were boring, some were mind wretching.
