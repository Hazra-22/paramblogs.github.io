            The answer requires the knowledge of one hundred year of Physics.
            But in layman terms, a four dimensional world is entirely made up
            by the minds of great physicist to understand relativity. People 
            earlier than Einstein has already thought of this thing. It was Einstein's 
            genius who taught us how to physically think the concept removing
            all complex mathematical jargon. Thanks to him! It is also natural to 
            think of a 4D world since all events around us require time to specify along 
            with spatial coordinates.
