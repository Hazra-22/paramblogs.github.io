        <p class="styled-paragraph">Every STEM fellow is familiar with the term "Quantum" though he might 
            be barely knowing the details. It all started in early 1900s when the 
            good old Planck had trouble in understanding his equation. Many great 
            men scratched their heads. But it was Einstein and Bose from India who
            could give some satisfactory answers. Later Heisenberg and his contemporary
            scientists taught us how to formally study this thing.
